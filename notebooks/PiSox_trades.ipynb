The right plot shows a zoom into the central part of the PSF, which reveals the bow-tie shape that we wanted to set up for this simulation. Fundamentally, the root cause of the bow-tie shape is the fact that we sub-aperture the mirrors. For any mirror, the scatter (from figure errors and particualte contamination) in the plane of the reflection is generally larger than the scatter perpendicular to the plane of reflection. This spreads out the photons more in one direction than the other and we choose the sub-aperturing such that the narrow direction of the bow-tie (the $y$-axis in the PiSoX coordinate system) is along the dispersion direction.\n",

If the blaze angle is small, i.e. the rays hit the grating parallel to the surface normal, then many rays will pass \"straight through\" to the zeroth order. Higher blaze angles favour higher orders. PiSox is designed for the blaze angle of 0.8 degree to maximise the number of photons that are diffracted into the first order where they will hit the multi-layer mirror at the blaze peak. We position the gratings such that a ray hitting the grating center has a blaze angle of 0.8 degrees. Since the gratings are located in a converging beam the blaze angle for rays hitting a flat grating near the edges is different from the nominal blaze angle. Fewer photons are diffracted into the first order and the effective area is reduced.\n",

    "This can be corrected by bending the gratings. If the grating surface follows a cylinder with a radius of curvature that matches the distance of the grating from the focal point, that effect can be almost entirely be compensated. The axis of that cylinder is parallel to the cross-dispersion direction. In other words, the grating is curved along the long side. On the other hand, bending almost every grating with a different radius of curvature increases the complexity and thus cost and schedule risk dramatically. Here, I study four different scenarios:\n",

Shown in a scatter plot of grating facet ID and observed blaze angle, where the facet ID is sorted by (but not proprotional to) the position along the optical axis. Again, for flat gratings, the blaze angle span a wide range. For bend gratings, the photons concentrate around 0.8 degrees. In the scenario with a single grating radius, the distribution is widest at the top and the bottom of the plot and narrower for gratings near the middle where the radius is closer to the average radius. In the scenario with two radii (one for upper and one for the lower grating sector) the distribution is narrowest in the middle of each sector, but even when the radius of curvature is chosen individually for each grating, the blaze angle is not exactly 0.8 degrees because the gratings also have a finite witdh in cross-dispersion direction."

    "\n",
    "PiSox uses a basline design with CAT gratings of 30 mm * 10 mm, where the long edge is parallel to the dispersion direction. In this trade, I test the choice of 10 mm width for the corss-dispersion direction. CAT gratings can be manufactured in larger sizes, but the ideal surface on which the gratings need to be placed is saddle-shaped. On the other hand, the design of the gratings requires the grating normal to be roughly perpendicular to the incoming rays. If the angle between ray and grating becomes large, then the support structures that hold the grating bars in place, in particular to so-called L2 support structure that is 0.5 mm deep, would cast large shadows and thus reduce the effective area. The grating membranes are fixed to the metal grating holder, which in turn is mounted to a larger mechanical structure. All these block some fraction of the area and thus reduce the number of rays that make it through to the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there are two competing effects: On the one hand, larger gratings reduce the number of and thus area lost to these mounting structures; on the other hand, we have the constrained that the CAT grating normals are close to the direction of the incoming rays. Thus, the larger the grating, the more do the regions on the edges deviate from the surface on which the diffraction should happen. Instead, some rays hit the grating where it is located \"above\" the theoretical surface, and some \"below\". In the the first case, photons are diffracted too far, on the latter to little. Both can cause photons to arrive at the ML mirror at a position that does not match the Bragg peak for their wavelength.\n",
